let, const, and arrow functions.

-

let and const are upgraded variables.

let: variables that might be changed later.
const: variables that doesn't need to be changed later. 

both are block-scoped so if you declare it inside curly braces, it will only exist there.

why let and const is better than var?
simple: var is function-scoped or globally-scoped. not block-scoped.

arrow functions

arrow functions provide more concise syntax for writing functions.

it simply replaces function with =>

it can also omit {} and return when the function body is just a simple expression.
