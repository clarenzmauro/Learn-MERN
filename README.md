# MERN Stack Learning Plan

Speed-learning this one...

## Week 1: Getting Started - The Bare Essentials

-   **Day 1: What's MERN?**
    *   Think of it as a popular toolkit (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for building websites and apps.
    *   Why use it? It's all JavaScript!
-   **Day 2: JavaScript Basics 101**
    *   Variables (containers for info), data types (text, numbers), and functions (do-stuff blocks).
-   **Day 3: Modern JavaScript (ES6+)**
    *   Arrow functions (shorter functions), `let` & `const` (better variables).
-   **Day 4: Async JavaScript**
    *   Sometimes code needs to wait; Promises help manage this.
-   **Day 5: Intro to Node.js**
    *   JavaScript outside the browser! Your first "Hello World" server.
-   **Day 6: NPM & Your First Express App**
    *   NPM is like a candy store for code packages.
    *   Express helps build web servers easily.
-   **Day 7: Git & GitHub Basics**
    *   Saving your code history and sharing it. Super important!

## Week 2: Building the Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)

-   **Day 8: Express Routing**
    *   How different web addresses (URLs) trigger different code on your server.
-   **Day 9: Express Middleware**
    *   Little helper functions that process requests.
-   **Day 10: RESTful APIs Explained**
    *   The "rules" for how your frontend and backend will talk.
-   **Day 11: Intro to MongoDB**
    *   A database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like way.
-   **Day 12: MongoDB CRUD Operations**
    *   Create, Read, Update, Delete data â€“ the basic actions.
-   **Day 13: Mongoose Magic**
    *   Makes using MongoDB with Node.js much simpler with schemas (data blueprints).
-   **Day 14: Connecting Express to MongoDB**
    *   Let's make your server talk to your database!

## Week 3: Crafting the Frontend (React)

-   **Day 15: What is React?**
    *   A library for building user interfaces with reusable pieces.
    *   `create-react-app` for a quick start.
-   **Day 16: JSX & Components**
    *   Writing HTML-like stuff in your JavaScript.
    *   Components are your UI building blocks.
-   **Day 17: Props & State**
    *   Props are how components get data; state is data a component manages itself.
-   **Day 18: Handling Events in React**
    *   Making things happen when users click or type.
-   **Day 19: Conditional Rendering**
    *   Showing different things based on certain conditions.
-   **Day 20: React Hooks (`useState` & `useEffect`)**
    *   Simpler ways to manage state and side effects (like fetching data).
-   **Day 21: Fetching Data in React**
    *   Getting information from your backend API to display.

## Week 4 & Beyond (Days 22-30): Full MERN & Project Time!

-   **Day 22: Connecting React to Your Express API**
    *   The full MERN stack in action!
-   **Day 23: Basic Authentication Concepts**
    *   How login/signup could work (keep it high-level).
-   **Day 24: Project Idea & Planning**
    *   Brainstorm a simple but decent project. What features will it have?
-   **Day 25: Project: Backend Setup**
    *   Create your database models and API routes for the first feature.
-   **Day 26: Project: Frontend for Feature 1**
    *   Build the React components to interact with your backend.
-   **Day 27: Project: Add Another Feature**
    *   Repeat backend and frontend steps for a new part.
-   **Day 28: Project: Styling & Polish**
    *   Make it look presentable!
-   **Day 29: Project: Testing & Bug Fixing**
    *   Make sure it works smoothly.
-   **Day 30: Project Showcase & Deployment Teaser**
    *   Show off what you built! Briefly mention how one might put it online.
