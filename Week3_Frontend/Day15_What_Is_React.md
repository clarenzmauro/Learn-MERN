React - a javascript library for building user interfaces

react is component-based. you build your UI by breaking it down into smaller, independent, and reusable pieces called components.

react is declarative. you don't have to manually manipulate DOM elements step-by-step

the easiest way to create a react project is using create-react-app. all you need is node.js and npm installed in your computer.

public/ - contains static assets

src/ - contains actual react js code
src/index.js - js entry point for your react app
src/App.js - the main top-level component
src/App.css - css for styling app component
src/index.css - global css styles
src/logo.svg - react logo on default page

package.json - lists project dependencies

npm start - starts the dev server with live reload
npm run build - bundles your app into static files for prod
npm test - runs test using Jest
npm run eject - removes create-react-app abstraction
